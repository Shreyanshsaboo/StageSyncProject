StageSync is an advanced JavaFX application engineered to revolutionize gig coordination for
independent musicians, bands, and venue managers. Built with a modern, gradient-based user interface
and integrated with a MySQL backend, the platform centralizes live event planning through role-specific
dashboards and real-time data synchronization. Musicians can create detailed profiles, upload audio
portfolios, and browse gig listings filtered by genre, location, and payment range, while venues publish
opportunities with customizable requirements such as equipment needs and audience capacity. The
system’s architecture employs MVC design patterns, ensuring separation between the dynamic UI layer—
featuring tabbed navigation for gig discovery, booking history, and profile management—and the business
logic handling availability checks and conflict resolution.

Automated triggers within the database enforce gig status integrity, preventing double bookings by
instantly updating availability flags when artists confirm engagements. Parameterized SQL queries and
prepared statements mitigate injection risks, while bcrypt hashing secures user credentials during
authentication. Venue managers benefit from an approval workflow that vets artist submissions against
predefined criteria, streamlining the booking process. Real-time updates propagate through socket-based
notifications, ensuring all users view current gig statuses without manual refresh. Additional features
include calendar integration for tracking confirmed events, revenue projection tools based on historical
bookings, and exportable performance reports for tax documentation.
